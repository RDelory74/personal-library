# ðŸ“š personal-library

This project is a **Nuxt-based personal library** where I store all reusable components, layouts, UI snippets and utilities I might need in future digital projects.  
It serves as a development playground and a reference hub to speed up future builds.

## ðŸ§± Tech Stack

- **Nuxt 3** â€“ The core framework
- **Tailwind CSS** â€“ Utility-first styling
- **Lucide Icons** â€“ For elegant, modern icons
- **Optional CSS** â€“ Some components may use plain CSS when necessary

---

```bash
